# eCommerce-backEnd-ORM
Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, plays a significant role within the electronics industry, as it empowers businesses and consumers alike to conveniently engage in online buying and selling of electronic products. In the latest available data from 2021, the industry in the United States alone was estimated to have generated the substantial amount of US$2.54 trillion, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.
Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. You’ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Description
This application is the back end for an e-commerce site. It uses Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The database includes tables for products, categories, tags, and product tags. RESTful API routes are used to make requests and updates from the database which are joined through Sequelize queries. The application is not deployed, but a walkthrough video demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies with 

```npm install```

and update .env file.
3. Start the server with 

```npm start```

## Usage

Usage of the eCommerce back end ORM is to allow users to view, add, edit, and delete categories, products, and tags in an e-commerce database. This project is helpful in the way of building an all-purpose back-end to use in a real-world setting.
